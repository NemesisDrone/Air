The Vl53 component
==================

Integration of multiple Vl53 sensors for measuring distances.
Component name: `vl53`.

Configuration
-------------

This component is designed to handle multiple Vl53 sensors.
If you want to handle multiple sensors, you **will** need to bind both `XSHUTS` pins to 2 different GPIOs.

You need to indicate the GPIOs used for the `XSHUTS` pins in the fields at the beginning of the
`src.vl53.vl53.Vl53Component` class.

.. code-block:: python

    class Vl53Component(component.Component):

        ...

        # For using multiple sensors, XSHUTS pins must be used.
        # First sensor XSHUTS pin
        FIRST_SENSOR_XSHUTS_PIN_NUMBER = 20
        # Second sensor XSHUTS pin
        SECOND_SENSOR_XSHUTS_PIN_NUMBER = None

        ...

.. warning::
    There might be a chance that even a single sensor will not work if the `XSHUTS` pin is not connected to a GPIO.
    If you see that the sensor is not working, try to connect the `XSHUTS` pin to a GPIO and set the `XSHUTS` pin number

Custom Status
-------------

The component publishes and set a custom status message to `sensors:vl53:status`.

.. code-block::

    {
    "sensing_worker_alive": boolean,
    "first_sensor_emulation": boolean,
    "second_sensor_emulation": boolean,
    }

The `sensing_worker_alive` field indicates if the sensing worker is alive or not.

The `first_sensor_emulation` and `second_sensor_emulation` fields indicate if the first and second sensors are emulated or not.

.. note::
    If both sensors are emulated, distances will be different and generated in the range [100, 600] mm.
    If only one sensor is emulated, the emulated sensor will copy the other sensor's distance.

Data
----

The component publishes and set the data to `sensors:vl53:ranges`.

.. code-block::

    {
    "first_range": int,
    "second_range": int,
    }


The `first_range` and `second_range` fields indicate the distance measured by the first and second sensors in mm.

.. note::
    If the distance measured is above 1100 mm, the value will be set to 0.
    Even with the limitation above, the distances is uploaded as is without parsing so it can be sometimes a bit noisy.
