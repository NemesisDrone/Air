The Sim7600 component
=====================

Integration of the sim7600H raspberry pi hat for GNSS positioning and 4G connectivity.
Component name: `sim7600`

Custom Status
-------------

The component publishes and set a custom status message to `sensors:sim7600:status`.

.. code-block::

    {
    "gnss_worker_alive": boolean,
    "gnss_emulation": boolean
    }

The `gnss_worker_alive` field indicates if the GNSS worker is alive or not.

.. warning::
    Even if this field is set to `true`, the GNSS worker may still be initializing and so not broadcasting any position.
    The value of the key/value storage would be an empty string in this case.

The `gnss_emulation` field indicates if the GNSS worker is emulating a position or not. If this field is set to `true`,
the sim7600 is not recognized and data is emulated.

Data
----

The component publishes and set the data to `sensors:sim7600:gnss`.

.. code-block::

    {
    "fixMode": int,
    "gpsSat": int,
    "gloSat": int,
    "beiSat": int,
    "lat": tuple[int, float],
    "latInd": str,
    "lon": tuple[int, float],
    "lonInd": str,
    "date": str,
    "time": str,
    "alt": float,
    "speed": float,
    "course": str,
    "pdop": float,
    "hdop": float,
    "vdop": float,
    "timestamp": float
    }


The `fixMode` field is not meaningful.

The `gpsSat`, `gloSat` and `beiSat` fields are the number of satellites used for the fix.

The `lat` and `lon` fields are the latitude and longitude in degrees and minutes, e.g. (48, 123.4567) for 48Â° 123.4567'.

The `latInd` and `lonInd` fields are the latitude and longitude indicators, e.g. N and E.

.. warning::
    If the latitude indicator is S, the latitude degrees must be multiplied by -1.
    If the longitude indicator is W, the longitude degrees must be multiplied by -1.

The `date` and `time` fields are the date and time of the fix. The format is DDMMYY and HHMMSS.XX.

The `alt` field is the altitude in meters.

The `speed` field is the speed in km/h. This field is not tested and may be wrong.

The `course` field is the course in degrees. This field is not tested and may be wrong.

The `pdop`, `hdop` and `vdop` fields are the pdop, hdop and vdop.

The `timestamp` field is the timestamp obtained with `time.time()`.
